# platform-ui

The main frontend application for users to play games, place bets, manage profiles, and interact with the platform in real time.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_API_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_MATCHMAKING_API_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GAME_STATE_API_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTING_WAGER_API_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_MESSAGING_API_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENTS_API_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEADERBOARD_RANKING_API_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHEAT_DETECTION_API_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION_API_URL=
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
